# NasGame

# TODO

Change the name under which the game banners/icons/grids are being saved. (issues to to capital letters and mismatches. (such as FEZ))
the name that is displayed on the libaray card must exactly match the image name other wise it will fail.
If the request produces an image under a slightly different name such as game: EDITION then it will always attempt to re-download the images even if they might be present under a different name.

stop using env::current_dir()
might cause trouble in the future
